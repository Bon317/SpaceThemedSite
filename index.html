        <h2>Inbetween Earth and Mars</h2>
        <p>
          The distance from Earth to Mars varies a lot, because Earth’s orbit around the sun is might smaller than Mars’ orbit. Earth is the third planet from the sun, and Mars is the fourth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine two cars on a racetrack, and one is always on the inside while the other is on the outside. Earth is on the inside track, and so it gets around more quickly. Sometimes it’s close to Mars, when it’s making a pass, and other times it’s far away, at the other side of the track.
        </p>
        <p>
          The minimum distance from the Earth to Mars is about 54.6 million kilometers. The farthest apart they can be is about 401 million km. The average distance is about 225 million km.

        <h2>Mars</h2>

        <p>
          Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. Befitting the Red Planet's bloody color, the Romans named it after their god of war. In truth, the Romans copied the ancient Greeks, who also named the planet after their god of war, Ares. Other civilizations also typically gave the planet names based on its color — for example, the Egyptians named it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one," while ancient Chinese astronomers dubbed it "the fire star."
        </p>
        <p>
          The bright rust color Mars is known for is due to iron-rich minerals in its regolith — the loose dust and rock covering its surface. The soil of Earth is a kind of regolith, too, albeit one loaded with organic content. According to NASA, the iron minerals oxidize, or rust, causing the soil to look red.

        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        <p>
          Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined
        </p>
        <p>
          Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.
